# HOW TO USE THIS PROJECT
## A Review of Deep Learning Techniques for Markerless Human Motion on Synthetic Datasets

**Based on DeepLabCut toolbox, we run with three synthetic datasets**
- Easy Pose Datasets: contains T-pose, A-pose, standing and seating
- Inter Pose Datasets: has walking and running
- Hard Pose Datasets: includes all the postures with high complexity like yoga, push-ups, and activities

Our project is available at https://github.com/DoanDuyVo/DeepLab_Human 

Research paper is also available at https://github.com/DoanDuyVo/DeepLab_Human/blob/main/DeepLab_Human_Paper.pdf

The original version of DeepLabCut can be found step-by-step in the user guide at https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut
